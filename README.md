The provided model predicts whether an item's price is high, with occasional false positives (FP). The notebook systematically explores strategies to optimize precision by adjusting different parameters (final_ceiling, upper_bound, and reliability_score) and finds optimal multipliers and thresholds.

Implemented Solutions:
Multiplier-based optimization for final_ceiling:
Evaluates multipliers from 1.0 to 3.0 in increments of 0.1.
Reports best multipliers improving precision, recall, and F1.

Multiplier-based optimization for upper_bound:
Similar optimization for upper_bound, aiming to reduce FP.
Determines optimal multipliers across various levels.

Threshold optimization using reliability_score:
Finds optimal cutoff thresholds for reliability_score to switch between final_ceiling and upper_bound.

Combined optimization:
Integrates the best thresholds and multipliers discovered above.
Proposes a comprehensive, optimized approach combining all metrics.
